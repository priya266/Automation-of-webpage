# Automation-of-webpage
#Test Case 01 : PageAutomationTest 
Firstly, I tried to automate the recommendation dropdown. As an user , when i first login into any online shopping portal , my mind would navigate to the filtering options which will be gloomy to my eyes as "Discoumt or " Sale" . Initially, I thought of automating only one, but have automated all the5 icons displayed in the drop down where i have navigated using indexes. 

# Test Case 02 : Price Tracker 
Second thought which hitted me was that this isnt the time for high dozy shopping so lets minimise the budget and look what can I best from the available options. So, I have automated the slider of the price range with random offset value (with the help of coordinates) . I have automated successfully by moving the x and y coordinate front and back according to value i took. And later I was trying to automate that coordinate value which yeah didnt worked well as ther was no coordinates in the HTML Page or in DOM view. (Spend extra hours as it interested me that there should be an way, some more time i would have automated the coordinates). This enthusiasts me to dig into deep about using different selectors and xpath method. 

#Test case 03 : Search Icon 
After filtering, just likea bomb hits my mind hitted with why dont you serach for what you need. As said , Demand in a way that you can get it done in a focused way. I searched initially for fullhandsleevesthen later for a haiclips and chosed one clip randomly and added them to cart. I tried to login with gmail before proceeding, due to security issue it was blocked and also phone number verification required some manual effort but tried to automate that by redirecting it to mailinator . Didnt work well. But did same in previous compaany wher the mail source have been public for automation purpose. 

#Test Case 4: Add to cart 
Almost a peppytouch , I added my clip to cart . The main thing it got shifted to another window which should be handled with iterators . Checked whether it will bedelivered to my pincode and added to cart. (I tried skiiping the step of entering mobile or gmail, I did that manually after that I automated till entering the card details). It took oly a bit time as i was keenly into it didnt notice the time. But I did it. 

#Test Case 5 : Focusing on other filters
I focused on extra filters like filtering out colour , entering brand names etc...   It was going smoothly. I got stuck in one state where even after taking multiple xpaths, trying out multiple methods, tryingdifferent wait and reducing them , with sleep which was my last idea  where I couldnt figureout  the method after multiple tries. I thought i can solve it but got stuck . The page was also getting unresponsive in the middle. Te Element clickable is often getting changed. The thing is im trying it out still and would have definitely solved it if I had my time a bit extra or with help from any of them.
